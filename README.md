## BookCars

BookCars is a car rental platform, supplier-oriented, with a backend for managing car fleets and bookings, as well as a frontend and a mobile app for renting cars.

Deploy your own customizable car rental solution at minimal cost using our [Docker-based setup](https://github.com/aelassas/bookcars/wiki/Installing-(Docker)). The platform integrates Stripe for secure payments and can be efficiently hosted on a 1GB RAM droplet, making it an ideal choice for single/multi-supplier operations looking for a scalable, cost-effective solution. You can deploy this solution for under $5 monthly using cloud providers like [Hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com/cloud/) or [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/pricing/droplets).

BookCars is designed to work with multiple suppliers. Each supplier can manage his car fleet and bookings from the backend. BookCars can also work with only one supplier and can be used as a car rental aggregator.

From the backend, admins can create and manage suppliers, cars, locations, customers and bookings.

When new suppliers are created, they receive an email prompting them to create an account in order to access the backend and manage their car fleet and bookings.

Customers can sign up from the frontend or the mobile app, search for available cars based on pickup and drop-off points and time, choose a car and complete the checkout process.

A key design decision was made to use TypeScript instead of JavaScript due to its numerous advantages. TypeScript offers strong typing, tooling, and integration, resulting in high-quality, scalable, more readable and maintainable code that is easy to debug and test.
